# Customer Classification for Ads Targeting Campaigns
In today's competitive market, targeted advertising is crucial for businesses to reach their desired audience and maximize their return on investment. This project aims to develop a customer classification model that can predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase based on their demographic and financial characteristics. By analyzing a dataset of 400 customer observations, including features such as gender, age, estimated salary, and purchase history, we will train a machine learning model to identify high-potential customers and optimize advertising campaigns. The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of advertising efforts and drive business growth through data-driven insights.
## Dataset Description
This dataset contains 400 observations of customer data, aimed at classifying customers for targeted advertising campaigns. The features include:
- User ID: Unique identifier for each customer
- Gender: Male or Female
- Age: Customer's age
- Estimated Salary: Customer's estimated annual salary
- Purchase: Binary variable indicating whether the customer made a purchase (1) or not (0)
## Goal
The goal of this dataset is to train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase, based on their demographic and financial characteristics. This will enable targeted advertising campaigns to reach high-potential customers.
## Features
